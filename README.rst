===================
MIADB-visualization
===================

    This repository provides tools and scripts designed for chemists and researchers who are new to Python scripting, specifically in the context of mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and molecular structure analysis.

The repository leverages the **MatchMS** Python library to calculate various MS/MS similarity scores, allowing for a more effective comparison of mass spectrometry data.
It also includes functionalities for visualizing these similarity scores using **Seaborn** heatmaps. 

Additionally, the repository contains a script for calculating **Tanimoto similarity scores** between multiple molecular structures and visualizing structural similarities as a tree.
Another script is included to visualize the ion distribution within complex datasets, enhancing the understanding of mass spectrometry results.

This repository was used during the **MIADB update** to explore the chemical diversity of **Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids (MIAs)**.
The tools and methods in this repository are applicable to a wide range of chemical and biological research involving mass spectrometry and molecular similarity analysis.
