===================
MIADB-visualization
===================

    This repository provides tools and scripts designed for chemists and researchers who are new to Python scripting, specifically in the context of mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and molecular structure analysis.

The repository leverages the `matchms <https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to calculate various MS/MS similarity scores, allowing for a more effective comparison of mass spectrometry data.
It also includes functionalities for visualizing these similarity scores using `seaborn <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>`_ heatmaps. 

Additionally, the repository contains a script for calculating **Tanimoto coefficients** between multiple molecular structures and visualizing structural similarities as a tree.
Another script is included to visualize the ion distribution within complex datasets, enhancing the understanding of mass spectrometry results.

This repository was used during the **MIADB update** to explore the chemical diversity of **Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids (MIAs)**.
The tools and methods in this repository are applicable to a wide range of chemical and biological research involving mass spectrometry and molecular similarity analysis.

Features
--------

* **MS/MS Similarity Calculation**:
    * Use of the **matchms** library to calculate various MS/MS similarity scores.
        * `Reference <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02411>`_
        * `Documentation <https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

* **Heatmap Visualization**: 
    * Visualize MS/MS similarity scores as heatmaps using the **Seaborn** library.

* **Tanimoto Structural Similarity**:
    * Compute **Tanimoto similarity scores** between molecular structures.
    * Visualize the structural similarities as a **tree diagram**.

* **Ion Distribution Visualization**:
    * A script to visualize the repartition of ions in complex mass spectrometry datasets.


üí™ Getting Started
------------------

We use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ to manage dependencies.

.. code-block:: sh

    if command -v poetry &> /dev/null; then echo "Poetry is already installed."; poetry --version; else echo "Poetry is not installed. Installing Poetry..."; curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -; fi


.. code-block:: sh

    poetry install


Then, you should be able to run the notebooks:

.. code-block:: sh

    poetry run python3 notebooks/generate_heatmap.py
    poetry run python3 notebooks/generate_heatmap.py --measure-type spec2vec --model-path ../../Downloads/spec2vec_AllPositive_ratio05_filtered_201101_iter_15.model
    poetry run python3 notebooks/generate_heatmap.py --measure-type ms2deepscore --model-path ../../Downloads/ms2deepscore_model.pt


‚ö†Ô∏è For the Spec2Vec and MS2DeepScore metrics to work, you'll need to download the models first as stated in their respective documentations.

In case you need help:

.. code-block:: sh

    poetry run python3 notebooks/generate_heatmap.py --help


‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS
