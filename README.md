# Data-processing-and-visualization

This repository is intended for chemists unfamiliar with or new to Python scripting.
It combines the use of the MatchMS Python library to calculate various MS/MS similarity scores (documentation website : https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, reference : Huber et al., (2020). matchms - processing and similarity evaluation of mass spectrometry data.. Journal of Open Source Software, 5(52), 2411, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02411) and enables visualization of these MS/MS similarity scores as heatmaps using the Seaborn library.
We also added code to calculate Tanimoto scores between multiple structures and visualize structural similarities as a tree, along with an additional script to visualize the repartition of ions in a complex dataset.

This repository was used within the MIADB update to explore the chemical diversity of Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids (MIAs).
