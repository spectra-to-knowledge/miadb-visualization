# Mass-spectrometry-clustering-tendency-on-Heatmap

This repository is intended for chemists unfamiliar or beginner with Pyhton scripts. 
It combines the use of the MatchMS pyhton library to calculate several MS/MS similarity scores (documentation website : https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, reference : Huber et al., (2020). matchms - processing and similarity evaluation of mass spectrometry data.. Journal of Open Source Software, 5(52), 2411, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02411) and enables the visualization of those MS/MS similarity scores under the form of heatmaps using the Seaborn library. 
We also added a code enabling the Tanimoto score calculation between several structures and visualization of the structural similarities under the form of a tree. 
We used it in the framework of the MIADB update to explore the chemical diversity of the Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids (MIAs).
